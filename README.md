## visuals-in-r
first time practicing with data graphics and visualizations in r.

### this project includes 3 problems:
problem 1 uses the 'Auto' dataset which includes identifying the difference between qualitative and quantitative predictors and basic visualizations among quantitative predictors.

problem 2 uses the 'CodParasite' dataset which includes information about parasite infections for cod fish in addition to different attributes for each fish that might be prevalent to parasite prevalence. instead of just using simple scatterplots to view association between variables, we can also use boxplots to see if variables are associated to one another.

problem 3 uses the 'Owls' dataset where the response variable is NegPerChick, which represents the number of negotiations with a parent that a chick must make before it is fed.
